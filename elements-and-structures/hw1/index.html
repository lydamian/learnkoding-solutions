   <h2>What are trees?</h2>
   <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem,
      or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves.
      In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,
      including only wood plants with secondary growth,
      plants that are usable as lumber or plants above
      a specified height.
