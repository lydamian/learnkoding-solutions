  <h1>A guide to finding answers</h1>
  <p>
    Ever find yourself wondering about something?<br />
    A great place to start is by searching <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google!</a><br />
    Encyclopedias are also great sources of information although it may be hard to navigate.<br />
    Also dont be afraid to ask people in person! <strong>Humans</strong> are great sources of information.<br/>
